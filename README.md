Now Prototype It Design System
====

This is the design system used for Now Prototype It's website and the Manage Prototype pages inside our prototype kit.

We use this as a plugin to Now Prototype It in order to:

- Test the system from the perspective of a plugin developer
- See what templates are most useful when designing
- Provide an example of how we think plugins are best managed
- Visualise, improve and test our new designs

Feel free to try using it as a plugin in your own prototype kit to see how it works or use it as a starting point for your own design system.
