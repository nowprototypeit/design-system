Now Prototype It Design System
====

This initial version of the Now Prototype It Design System has been created retrospectively to capture how the components and templates work.

We're using this as a plugin to Now Prototype It in order to:

- Test the system from the perspective of a plugin developer
- See what templates are most useful when designing
- Provide an example of how we think plugins are best managed
- Visualise, improve and test our new designs

What's coming next
---

Our current design is very much focussed on functionality, however we're now working on updated designs which have a more polished look and feel with the same functionality.  Watch this space.
